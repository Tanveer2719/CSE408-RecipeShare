## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications. Next.js powers the entire frontend, ensuring fast load times and great SEO.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design visually appealing and responsive web pages without writing custom CSS. Tailwind's approach allows rapid development with a clean, scalable design.

### Backend
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that facilitates rapid development of secure and maintainable web applications. Django powers the backend, handling user authentication, recipe management, and other API services.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database used to store all data, including user profiles, recipes, ratings, and comments. PostgreSQL provides robustness and scalability for the backend.

### Third-Party API
- **Meal Planning API**: A third-party API integrated to calculate personalized calorie requirements for users. The API takes user inputs and provides meal suggestions tailored to meet specific nutritional goals.

## Architecture Overview

The **RecipeShare** application follows a classic **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

- **Model**: The Django ORM is used to define models for users, recipes, ratings, reviews, and meal plans. PostgreSQL serves as the database for storing these models.
- **View**: The frontend, built with Next.js, interacts with the backend through REST APIs and dynamically updates the user interface.
- **Controller**: Django views handle the logic for managing user requests, performing CRUD operations on recipes, and calculating calorie requirements based on meal planning inputs.

## Getting Started

To run the RecipeShare application locally, you will need the following software:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - Required for the frontend development.
- **Python 3.x** - Required for the backend development with Django.
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database system to store and manage data.
